.Sh NAME
.Nm meltdown
.Nd Meltdown and Spectre PoC for OpenBSD
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm
.Op Fl ms
.Op Fl iqvT
.Op Fl n Ar minrounds
.Op Fl t Ar threshold
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
utility attempts to exploit the Meltdown and Spectrure vulnerabilities.
It tries to read information from kernel space by exploiting these CPU flaws.
.Pp
The options are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Fl m
Attempts to exploit the Meldown vulnerability.
This is default behavior.
.It Fl s
Attempts to exploit the Spectre vulnerability.
.It Fl i
Outputs the detailed CPU information.
Multiple uses of
.Fl i
increases CPU information details.
.It Fl q
Starts the quick mode.
.It Fl v
Outputs verbose debug information.
Multiple uses of
.Fl v
increases verbosity.
.It Fl T
Don't read kernel memory.
.Nm
attempts to read userspace memory of itself by the use of this flag.
.It Fl n Ar minrounds
Do at least
.Ar minrounds
rounds to an address.
After
.Ar minrounds
rounds stop if we have at least one cache hit.
One round per address to be read should be enough;
but multiple rounds can help to filter clutter.
The default value is 1.
.It Fl t Ar threshold
Sets the cache hit timing threshold to
.Ar threshold .
.El
.Sh EXIT STATUS
The
.Nm
utility exits 0 if no vulnerability could be exploited.
If an usage error occurs
.Nm
exits 1.
.Sh AUTHORS
The
.Nm
utility was written by
.An Gerhard Roth Aq Mt gerhard@openbsd.org .
